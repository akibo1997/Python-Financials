Welcome to Python Poll! 
    
    In this folder you will find the code that counts the votes as 'main.py' and all of the resources for the code in the 'resources' file. 
    
    The goal of this project was to find a way to count the votes for an imaginary location that needed to be able to tally their votes in an automated fashion. See the python code to find out how I leveraged the modules to calculate the tally for each candidate in an innovative way, calculating thousands of rows of data one row of code at a time. 

    Enjoy!
